# math-series

**Author**: Milo Anderson
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
A set of functions to return mathematical series numbers

## Getting started
Run "pipenv shell" to create the environment; these functions were tested running Python 3.6

## Architecture
Three simple functions; each accepts a number n. fibonacci starts on 0 and returns the nth fibonacci number; lucas starts on 2 and returns the nth lucas number; sum_series accepts a starting number parameter (default = 0) and returns the nth sum series number.

## Change log
02-19-2019 3:00pm - All three functions are working & passing all tests
